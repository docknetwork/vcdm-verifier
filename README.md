# Example Implementation of issuing and verification of VCDM credentials with the Dock SDK

Not complete and may break easily as the SDK develops: https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk

### Setup

Install Node and Yarn for the frontend, start a dock-substrate node. Run `yarn` command to setup packages.

Running the frontend in development mode:

```
yarn dev
```
Running the frontend in production mode:

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Requires dock substrate node
Download and compile: https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-substrate

### GH Pages
- Run `yarn deploy` to deploy to GitHub pages

### Future Expansion
Would be great to migrate this project to React native and provide native mobile examples of SDK usage.
